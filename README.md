# Tic-Tac-Toe
The Tic-Tac-Toe Game is a simple and classic game developed using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Players take turns marking either an "X" or an "O" on a 3x3 grid, aiming to place three of their marks in a row (vertically, horizontally, or diagonally). The game provides real-time feedback, declaring a winner or a draw based on the gameplay.
